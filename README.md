# WeLoveMovies

### Project Description

I have been tasked to work as a backend developer on a project called WeLoveMovies! As other developers work on the design and frontend experience of the web application, I am responsible for setting up the database and building out the specific routes so that the users can gain access to data about movies, theaters, and reviews. 


### Project Walk-Through


#### Navigation 

From the navigation at the top, you can navigate to:
1. WeLoveMovies: This is the Home Page where you will find the entire catalog of movies
2. All Movies: This is the All Movies page where you will find the entire catalog of movies with descriptions, runtime, rating, average review rating, and more. 
3. All Theaters: This is the All Theaters page where you will find a list of movies that are playing at different theaters.

#### Home Page

From the Home Page you can browse all movies and click on the one you would like to get more information about right from the Home Page.
